# C-Projects
Find here the projects I made while learning C++

# 1. A Basic Calculator
This was my first C++ project, showcasing a basic calculator that handles the four simple arithmetical operations really well! I will be updating it with more versions as I go on and build more projects

# 2. Number Guessing Game with Levels
This project is a simple guessing game in which the user can choose the level (Difficulty) they start on.

The difficulties range from Easy to Medium and finally, Hard.

While building this project, I learnt about switch statements,  which helped my assign input from the user to a particular difficulty.

I also learnt some new header files, which allowed me to generate a random number that the user has to guess.

Finally, I strengthened my knowledge of functions, which I am not so strong in.
